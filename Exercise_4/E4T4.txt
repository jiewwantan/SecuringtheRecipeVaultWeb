# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
By placing Cloudfront before load balancer, creating a rule to route all SSH to instances through AWS System Manager, avoiding direct external access to application server. 

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No, VPC private endpoints alone do not prevent unauthorized access to the secrets bucket

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, only newly added objects to the bucket will be encrypted. 

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
All configuration/modification made through AWS management console will be reset to the original cloud formation templates.
