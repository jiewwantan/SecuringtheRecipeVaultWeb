# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

- Disable password authentication for the application server instance. 
- Restrict network traffic to the application server by configuring its security group. 
- Disable SSH access at most time, only have it enabled when it is absolutely necessary. 

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
- Limit instances profile role for the bucket
- Use least privilege access for instance role profile by allowing access only to specific buckets.
- Enable server-side encryption on the S3 buckets
