Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
IAM Role, InstanceRole is allowed full access to all s3 bucket instance. This doesn't comply to 
least privilege principle. Roles shall be defined specific access and acts on only specific resources.

# Poor practice 2
The WebAppSG security group allows ingress traffic to all ports aside from specifically port 22,80 and 5000.
This exposes the server and opens up a series of attack vector.
