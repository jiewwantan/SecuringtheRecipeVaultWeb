Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1. Server-side encryption and logging is not enabled for S3 buckets.
2. Root access is anabled.
3. No implementation of Loadbalancer HTTP->HTTPS redirection
4. VPC Security Groups allow all ingress and egress traffic.
5. TCP port 5000 of the instances is anabled for internet access.
6. IAM policy is not compliant to principle of least privilege by allowing full access to resources. 

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1. Enable S3 server-side encryption and logging. 
2. Disable any unnecessary ports on all EC2 instances. 
3. Limit Security Groups traffic to only allow 80 and 443 and other security group to access AWS resource within their VPCs.
4. Allow redirection of all HTTP requests to HTTPS for Application Load Balancer.
5. Set IAM policies for to disable root user and to enforce MFA.
